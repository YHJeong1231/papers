# 📄 Undergraduate Conference Papers – Control Systems and Validation Studies

This folder contains three conference papers written during my undergraduate studies, focusing on **control system design**, **observer-based disturbance compensation**, and **simulation-driven validation**.

These works reflect my early training in fundamental control theory, dynamic system modeling, and optimization-based controller synthesis, which later formed the foundation for my graduate-level PMSM research.
