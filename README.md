## 🎯 Focus Areas

My master's research and projects primarily focus on PMSM systems, observer-based load torque estimation, and simulation-driven validation.  
In particular, I independently built a full simulation environment to study PMSM load torque estimation, from system modeling to controller and observer implementation.

My undergraduate work established a strong foundation in control theory, especially controller and observer design methodologies.
